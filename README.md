# IR2DMX

Project to create a device that allows the triggering of DMX devices using IR blasts/flashes.

Was used in a photoshoot with 2 3kW DMX flashes and a IR studio flash.

## History

Initially was meant to be really simple, just a couple of photodiodes and a RS-485 transceiver.

Feature creep turned it into a big, very adjustable flashy gimmick, as it does.

## Features

- Flash output on 2 configurable main channels
- Adjustable values for 2 more side channels per main channel
- Adjustable IR sensitivity
- Adjustable Pulse length
- PoX (Power over XLR)
- Display with convenient user interface
- Beautiful 3D printable box
- Camera mount compatible

Electronic schematics and 3D models may be uploaded later.
